# Retail Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the analysis of retail data focusing on customer responses and transactional data. The analysis includes SQL queries, Python data analytics, and visualizations in MS Excel.

## Overview

The project aims to analyze retail data to gain insights into customer behavior, response patterns, and transaction trends. The analysis covers the following aspects:

1. **SQL Data Analysis:**
   - Analyzed customer responses and transactional data using SQL queries to derive key metrics and insights.

2. **Python Data Analytics:**
   - Utilized Python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and advanced analytics on the retail dataset.

3. **MS Excel Visualizations:**
   - Created visualizations in MS Excel to present the findings and insights from the data analysis.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **sql_insights/**: Contains SQL scripts and queries used for data analysis on customer responses and transactional data.
- **Python_Analysis/**: Includes Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts for data analytics and advanced analytics using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- **MS_Excel_Visualizations/**: Holds Excel files with visualizations and charts representing the analysis results.
  - **Main_analysis_visualization.xlsx**: Excel file containing visualizations for the main analysis.
  - **Additional_analysis_visualization.xlsx**: Excel file containing visualizations for additional insights beyond the main analysis.

## Data Files
